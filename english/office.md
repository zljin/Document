A: Sure! Well, I graduated with honor from Huaihua University with a major in Computer Science.I chose this course of study because I wanted to be a software enginner.

Q: Now, tell me a little bit about your work experience. I see here that you previously worked at ABC.

A: I'm glad to share my experience at ABC. I spent 5 years working there, and it was an incredibly enriching journey.

At ABC, I focused on Java development for various financial applications. My main tasks included creating robust and secure code, handling api interactions, and ensuring the applications met strict performance and compliance standards

During my tenure at Oracle, I was primarily involved in developing enterprise-level applications using Java. I worked on several key projects where my responsibilities included writing efficient and scalable code, conducting code reviews, and optimizing application performance. 

A good example that comes to mind is when I was involved with a movemoney API developed, and in the half year since the release of the API, there have been 250,000 successful transfer transactions in the mobile app.

I also collaborated closely with cross-functional teams, including designers, product managers, and quality assurance engineers. This collaboration was crucial in ensuring that the final product met the business requirements and user expectations. In another project, our team faced tight deadlines and complex requirements. However, through effective communication and teamwork, we were able to deliver the project on time and exceed the client's expectations.

Overall, my experience at Oracle has not only enhanced my technical skills but also sharpened my ability to work effectively in a team environment and handle challenging projects. It has laid a solid foundation for my career as a Java developer.


Yes, in this position I was able to make some pretty significant contributions to
the overall success of the company. With the different initiatives that we
implemented, we lowered our churn rate to about five percent, which had a direct
impact on revenue.
